# Text Mining Projects üìòüîç
## Description
This repository hosts two text mining projects:

- Text Recommender: Enhances user experience by using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to correct spelling mistakes and suggest accurate words, mimicking the 'Did you mean...?' feature on search platforms.
- Message Spam Detection: Employs various machine learning models to classify messages as spam or not, aiming to improve filtering accuracy and user experience.

### Features
- Spelling Correction: Employs phonetic matching and distance metrics for spelling suggestions.
Integration Capability: Designed for integration into various platforms to enhance functionality.
- Spam Detection Models: Uses Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM for spam identification.
Advanced Feature Engineering: Incorporates Count Vectorization and TF-IDF Vectorization with features such as document length, digit count, and non-word character count.
- Model Evaluation: Utilizes ROC-AUC scores for evaluating model performance.

#### Libraries Stack
NLTK
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
CountVectorizer
TfidfVectorizer
